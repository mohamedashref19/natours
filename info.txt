So now the request-response path will be as follow:

Request sent to server

     -> server.js

          -> app.js (res and req object go through all the middlewares)

               -> routes (depends on the path, handled by respective router - userRoutes/tourRoutes)

                    -> controllers (depend on which HTTP method, handled by respective controllers - userControllers/tourControllers)

                         -> END of the request-response flow
